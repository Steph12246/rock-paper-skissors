# rock-paper-skissors
Original rock-paper-scissors.html was my starting point. I want to add in javascript and buttons so that it can be played without the pop up. 
rock-paper-scissors2.html is my attempt at this using the .js and the .css for styling and javascript
exapmle, is someone else's javascript for reference.
